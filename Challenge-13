# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project used coding skills in Pandas to extract source data from an excel file and a csv. Data were then transformed and cleaned. Examples of data cleaning included reordering of columns, removal of extra characters in fields, spliting first and last names into separate columns and spliting into multiple columns based on characters in the fields. Data were associated among four dataframes and merged into a combined dataframe. Then extra columns were removed. Some columns names were relabeled in the final combined csv.
In SQL, tables were made for each of the fours CSV files. The table structure was imported to QucikDBD to create an ETL.
